### Hi there I am Data Geek, Colleen👋


Now I am studying Applied Data Science at University of Chicago.

**I love Data Science, Machine Learning and how it can reveal hidden insights behind numbers**

I love sharing my knowledge and experience, contribute to open source projects related to Data Science, and sharing statistical problems as code on this repository.

My usual work duties are data analysis, data cleaning, building ML models to make the computers understand, predict, judge and make them smart.

I am looking forward to applying my knowledge and experience in building intelligent solutions to impact people’s lives and industries.
